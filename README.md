#Go Backspace for Google Chrome
| GBS for short.

GBS for Google Chrome, brings back the backspace (Back) functionality to your browser. Instead of having to reach down to your keyboard, to navigate a page backwards, all you have to do now is press the backspace key on your keyboard and you're set.

This extension will restore the functionality of pressing backspace to go to the previous page, and shift+backspace to go forward.
